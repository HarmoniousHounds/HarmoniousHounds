                  I am a qualified dog trainer, having completed Certificate IV in Companion Animal
                  Services. Dogs learn best with positive reinforcement and force free training. Trust and
                  respect are essential for any living being to learn effectively. Dogs do not speak the
                  same language as we do, so if we are to communicate effectively with them, it is
                  essential that we form a relationship built on trust. I do not use training methods
                  which make use of punishment or intimidation.

                  Hi, my name is Lyn, and my passion is dogs.
                  I have always had a special interest in animals, and have been involved in training my
                  own dogs for many years. Beginning with conformation and obedience, agility, retrieval
                  and scent work.
